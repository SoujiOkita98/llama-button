  <core_principles>
    1. High contrast and bold outlines.
    2. Raw, unpolished geometric shapes.
    3. Vibrant, clashing colors to create energy.
    4. Exaggerated proportions for the llama character.
  </core_principles>
  <color_philosophy>
    Use a stark black stroke (#000000) against a vibrant yellow (#FFD700) or hot pink (#FF69B4) background. The llama itself will be stark white. This creates a "sticker" look that pops off the screen, emphasizing the "button" nature.
  </color_philosophy>
  <layout_paradigm>
    The button is not just an element but the hero. It floats in a chaotic grid of other "sticker" elements (stars, lightning bolts) that are static, making the animated llama the clear focal point.
  </layout_paradigm>
  <signature_elements>
    1. Thick, hard-edged black borders (4px+).
    2. Drop shadows that are solid black and offset (no blur).
    3. Halftone patterns in the background.
  </signature_elements>
  <interaction_philosophy>
    Aggressive feedback. Hover doesn't just wiggle ears; the whole button might jitter or offset its shadow. Click feels heavy and mechanical.
  </interaction_philosophy>
  <animation>
    Frame-by-frame style animation (stop motion feel) for the ears rather than smooth tweening. 12fps wiggle.
  </animation>
  <typography_system>
    Font: 'Chivo Mono' or 'Space Mono'. Bold, uppercase, slightly tight tracking to fit inside the llama.
  </typography_system>

  <design_movement>Soft Kawaii / Pastel Dream</design_movement>
  <core_principles>
    1. Extreme softness and roundness (super-ellipses).
    2. Gentle, calming interactions.
    3. Airy composition with breathing room.
    4. Mimicry of plush toy textures visually.
  </core_principles>
  <color_philosophy>
    Pastel palette. Background: Mint Cream (#F5FFFA) or Lavender Blush. Llama: Fluffy White with soft grey outlines (#4A4A4A) instead of harsh black. Text: Dark Slate Blue. Evokes a feeling of comfort and playfulness.
  </color_philosophy>
  <layout_paradigm>
    The button sits on a "shelf" or a soft horizon line. The surrounding space is clean, perhaps with floating soft shapes (clouds) that parallax slightly on mouse move.
  </layout_paradigm>
  <signature_elements>
    1. Rounded line caps and joins on the SVG stroke.
    2. Subtle inner shadows to suggest depth/fluffiness.
    3. Blush cheeks on the llama.
  </signature_elements>
  <interaction_philosophy>
    Fluid and elastic. The ear wiggle is a physics-based spring motion, not a linear loop. The button "squishes" slightly on click.
  </interaction_philosophy>
  <animation>
    Smooth, high-frame-rate sine wave rotation for ears. Ease-in-out transitions.
  </animation>
  <typography_system>
    Font: 'Quicksand' or 'Fredoka'. Rounded terminals, friendly and approachable.
  </typography_system>

  <core_principles>
    1. Hand-drawn aesthetic (wobbly lines).
    2. Transparency and overlay effects.
    3. Focus on the "ink" quality of the stroke.
    4. Negative space defines the form.
  </core_principles>
  <color_philosophy>
    Monochrome plus one accent. Paper-like background (#FDFBF7). Ink black lines (#2C2C2C). The "Home" text acts as the fill texture.
  </color_philosophy>
  <layout_paradigm>
    The button appears to be sketched onto the page. No heavy containers or boxes around it. It integrates seamlessly into a "notebook" style layout.
  </layout_paradigm>
  <signature_elements>
    1. SVG filters to add "roughness" or "turbulence" to lines.
    2. Imperfect symmetry in the llama's shape.
    3. Text that looks like it was stamped or handwritten.
  </signature_elements>
  <interaction_philosophy>
    Organic. The ears don't just rotate; they might slightly reshape (morph) as if being redrawn.
  </interaction_philosophy>
  <animation>
    Subtle "boiling" line effect (lines wiggling slightly) even when static, intensifying on hover along with the ear wave.
  </animation>
  <typography_system>
    Font: 'Patrick Hand' or 'Amatic SC'. Handwritten style to match the sketched llama.
  </typography_system>
